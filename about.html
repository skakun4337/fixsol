            <p>The Coliseum Turn Order Calculator is a simple JavaScript tool designed to assist
                Flight Rising users in planning Coli teams. It calculates the initial turn order of a
                round of combat.</p>
            <p>Please note that the tool will not function if you browser has disabled JavaScript,
                and it may not display correctly in very old browsers. I recommend using the newest
                version of Firefox with JavaScript enabled if the tool isn't working. Failing that,
                please screenshot your browser's console (ctrl+shift+J in Firefox) and post about the
                problem in the <a href="https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/gde/2945135">forum thread.</a></p>

                <li><a href="https://fir-fr-coli-skills.firebaseapp.com/">Enemy Skills & Stats</a>:
                    A tool that contains the stats and attacks of every Coli enemy, as well as the STR
                    required to KO them in different ways. A very useful companion to the turn order
                    calculator for figuring out how to stat your dragon.</li>
                <li><a href="https://syl-fr-coli-stat-preview.firebaseapp.com/">Coli Stat Previewer</a>:
                    Another useful tool, this one simulates the Coli's stat allocation system so you
                    can verify that your stats are valid without having to mess with a real dragon's stats.</li>
